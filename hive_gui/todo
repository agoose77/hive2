Parse all hives (just check if inherits from HiveBuilder)
Parse all bees (just check if inherits from Bee)
Parse all parameters (just check if inherits from Parameter)

Control flow: Generic node manager -> Blender node manager

    How to connect hives with bees (in GUI and out)
    -> Restructure hive / bee distinction?
        -> Use optional from_socket to_socket in model.BeeConnection?
        -> Account for fact that bee != hivebee, maybe add another layer / more generic setup?
